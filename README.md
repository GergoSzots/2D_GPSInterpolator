This program was created mainly for ERT (Electrical Resistivity Tomography) data processing with Prosys III program.
One can use it for interpolation between local UTM GPS coordinates with a given distances (change "electrode_distance" variable for it) with ease.
The program creates a "line_name_topo.txt" file as well that can be used at topography settings within Prosys III to recalculate geometric factor four your quadripoles.
